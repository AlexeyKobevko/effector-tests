## Development

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

That should be enough to get started. It will open to http://localhost:3000

## Building

```
yarn build
yarn serve
```

yarn build will create the assets in `dist` - a `client` and `server` folder. Serve will run `dist/server.js` with Node, but feel free to change this to use Docker or some other process manager to suit your deployment needs.
